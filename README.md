### :man_technologist: About Me :

I am a full stack developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">, a husband, and a father :family_man_woman_girl:. I recently moved back to the United States with my family after 10+ years living in Asia. While there, I worked in a variety of professional roles, including as a [Fulbright Research Scholar](https://fulbrightscholars.org/) at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, a Communications Consultant for [Kenan Foundation Asia](https://www.kenan-asia.org/), and a Sr. Brand Strategist for [Quo Global](https://www.quo-global.com/) in Bangkok, Thailand. During this time, I travelled extensively throughout Asia and Europe, working on large-scale branding and design projects for the hospitality industry. I was also lucky enough to gain invaluable technical experience using Adobe InDesign & Illustrator, and working closely with our web designers to bring complex ideas to life. This experience got me curious about programming and eventually led me to Al Sweigart's excellent [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book/course, which captured my full attention and altered my professional goals.

In 2020, I became a father for the first time and my life took on a new sense of meaning and direction. Since then, I've been a full-time stay-at-home dad and a freelance brand consultant - I even launched my own freelance agency in Bangkok: [Five Spice Freelance](https://fivespicefreelance.com/). Staying home with our daughter for the first two years of her life was immensely rewarding and challenging, and it also gave me the opportunity to pursue programming further. With more time to invest in learning, I quickly grew to love programming and the intricate problem-solving mindset that it requires. I was hooked, as they say, and since then I've spent thousands of hours studying, coding, debugging, and building applications.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Web Development with JavaScript via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in building web applications that adhere to the design principles of Object Oriented Programming, in particular the SOLID design principles
