### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm a student, a husband, and a father :family_man_woman_girl: to a young daughter. After more than a decade out of the classroom, I've returned to school at Oregon State University [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) in pursuit of a second bachelor's degree in computer science. 
<!--
My journey to programming started a long time ago and involves many detours. When I was 7 - early 90's - we got our first family computer. At the time I was a bookish math nerd, obsessed with number and word puzzles, and my Dad was an economics professor with early computing experience, who had conducted his dissertation research using manual stacks of IBM punch cards. From an early age, he instilled in me a deep interest and curiousity in technology and its many applications.

Coming out of high school, I orginially enrolled as a math major, but after
I originally enrolled as a math major, but soon rediscovered my love for books, storytelling, and language

I applied for and recieved a [Fulbright Research Grant](https://fulbrightscholars.org/) to study the impact of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake on Chinese domestic tourism and migration. While there, I worked closedly with a professor from Sichuan University, conducting numerous research trips together and interviewing survivors. This experience opened my eyes 

at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. 

I moved to Bangkok, Thailand, with

In 2022, I moved back to the United States with my family after 10+ years of living in Asia. While there I worked in a variety of professional roles, including as a Sr. Brand Strategist for [Quo Global](https://www.quo-global.com/), a Communications Consultant for [Kenan Foundation Asia](https://www.kenan-asia.org/), and a [Fulbright Research Scholar](https://fulbrightscholars.org/) at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. 

During this time I travelled extensively for work throughout Asia and Europe, collaborating with multinational teams on large-scale branding and design projects. Along the way I gained invaluable technical experience, becoming proficient with Adobe InDesign & Illustrator and coordinating with in-house web development teams to bring complex ideas to life. It was this experience that first got me curious about programming.

and eventually led me to Al Sweigart's excellent [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book/course, which captured my full attention and changed my professional goals.
-->

In 2020, I became a father for the first time and my life took on a new sense of meaning and direction. Since then, I've been a full-time stay-at-home dad and a freelance brand consultant - I even launched my own freelance agency in Bangkok: [Five Spice Freelance](https://fivespicefreelance.com/). Staying home with our daughter for the first two years of her life was immensely rewarding and challenging, and it also gave me the opportunity to pursue programming further. With more time to invest in learning, I quickly grew to love programming and the intricate problem-solving mindset that it requires. I was hooked, as they say, and since then I've spent thousands of hours studying, coding, debugging, and building applications.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Web Development with JavaScript via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in building web applications that adhere to the design principles of Object Oriented Programming, in particular the SOLID design principles
